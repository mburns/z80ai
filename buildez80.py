"""
Build an eZ80 (ADL mode) binary for Agon Light / Console8 and friends.

The Z80 builds spend most of their effort working around 64KB: weights are
squeezed to two bits, activations to 16 bits, and layers are capped at 256
neurons because DJNZ counts in a byte.  An eZ80 in ADL mode has a 24-bit
address space, so this backend drops those compromises: 24-bit accumulators
(the 16-bit overflow the QAT loss trains against cannot happen at all), 24-bit
activations, and no byte counters anywhere, so layers may be any width.

Three kernels, chosen by size (``--kernel``, default ``auto``).  On the shipped
`guess` model, one forward pass costs:

  column   923,194 -> 39,605 instructions, 384KB.  Unrolled and accumulated
           input-major, so it skips zero *activations* as well as zero weights:
           only 8,192 of the model's 37,865 nonzero weights are actually
           reached, because the input vector is ~10% nonzero and hidden layers
           are 16-39%.  Accumulators live in memory rather than a register,
           costing an instruction per multiply-accumulate - a good trade when
           ~78% of columns are skipped outright.
  row      923,194 -> 90,340 instructions, 252KB.  Unrolled weight-major.
           ``LD DE,(nnnnnn)`` reaches any activation in one instruction, so a
           nonzero weight costs a load and an add and a zero weight costs
           nothing.  Cannot skip zero activations: which ones are zero changes
           every step.
  compact  923,194 instructions, 147KB.  One signed byte per weight, walked at
           runtime, neurons and layers closed by sentinels.  Visits every
           weight including the ~73% that are zero, so it is slow - but its
           size does not depend on the model, which makes it the only option
           once a model is too large to unroll.

Unrolling is what the address space actually buys.  An index list, which is
what the CP/M builds use, would still have to turn each index into an address,
and the accumulator sits in HL so ``LD DE,(HL)`` is unavailable.

Reordering and regrouping the sum - splitting it by weight sign, or walking it
input-major - is exact rather than approximate: the reference wraps the
accumulator to 24 bits, and addition mod 2**24 is associative and commutative.
The >>2 is the part that may never move, because it floors.

`auto` takes the first kernel whose image fits in Agon SRAM.  Note that ADL
addresses 16MB but a shipping Agon has 512KB, and that is the real ceiling.

Inference is otherwise identical to the Z80 version: the same trigram hashing,
the same {-2,-1,0,+1} weights, the same >>2 per layer, the same argmax.  A
model built for CP/M runs here unchanged and produces the same text, except
where the Z80 would have overflowed its accumulator - there the eZ80 is right
and the Z80 is not.
